print_buff() and printbuff print a static amount of elements of buffer. 
Currently this number is at 25 and 20 respectively. To edit this amount, 
you have to edit print_buff and/or printbuff.

At the moment the autochecker says my code does not compile because there are more than one declarations of simpleCharManager::simpleCharManager for both second and first memtest.cpp but on my VM it compiles and runs fine.
