print_buff() prints a static amount of elements of buffer. 
Currently this number is at 25. To edit this amount, 
you have to edit print_buff.

At the moment the autochecker says my code does not compile because there are more than one declarations of simpleCharManager::simpleCharManager but on my VM it compiles fine.
