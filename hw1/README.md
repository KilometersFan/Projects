print_buff() prints a static amount of elements of buffer. 
Currently this number is at 25. To edit this amount, 
you have to edit print_buff.

The class autochecker says that for some lines in flexChar
and simpleChar I convert from long int to int which may 
result in lost values. But on the VM, the programs run fine.
