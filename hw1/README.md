  - fragmentation.xyz shows the fragmentation of memory in the buffer array
  - first_memtest.cpp and second_memtest.cpp are programs that execute simple and flexible memory managers respectively

Running the programs
- To compile the cpp files use these commands
- g++ -g -Wall -std=c++11 hw1q5.cpp hw1q5
- g++ -g -Wall -std=c++11 palindrom.cpp palindrome
- g++ -g -Wall -std=c++11 first_memtest.cpp simpleCharManager.cpp first_memtest
- g++ -g -Wall -std=c++11 second_memtest.cpp simpleCharManager.cpp flexCharManager.cpp second_memtest

To run these programs use these commands
./hw1q5
./palindrome
./first_memtest
./second_memtest
